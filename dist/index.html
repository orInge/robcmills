          <h3>coder, engineer, linguist, artist</h3>
          <p>I love programming, conceptual design, languages, and aesthetics. I derive a deep sense of satisfaction from the process of learning, creating, and implementing efficient software solutions, manipulating data to be more palatable, and crafting elegant, extensible, intuitive interfaces.</p>
          <p>Having been a fast-paced FPS PC gamer most of my life, I have a particular passion for optimizing code and low latency. My highly tuned gaming configs made extensive use of key-bindings, which translated nicely to Vim-style modal editing. I use Sublime Text Vintage mode fluently, along with macros and scripts to quickly and productively manipulate code.</p><img id="intp" src="img/intp_logo.png">
          <p>In terms of the <a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org">Myers Briggs personality types</a> I am <b>INTP</b>: <br> <b>I</b>ntroverted i<b>N</b>tuitive <b>T</b>hinking <b>P</b>erceptive</p>
          <p class="quote"><i>"INTP's seek to develop logical explanations for everything that interests them. Theoretical and abstract, interested more in ideas than in social interaction. Quiet, contained, flexible, and adaptable. They have an unusual ability to focus in depth to solve problems in their area of interest. Skeptical, sometimes critical, always analytical."</i></p><img id="way_things_work" src="img/way_things_work.jpg">
          <p>My favorite book as a child was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Things-Work-David-Macaulay/dp/0590429892/ref=pd_sim_b_5">The Way Things Work</a> by David Macaulay, and my favorite toy was my latest Legos set. I think that pretty much sums up my strongest personality trait. I love learning about and understanding the world around me, and then using that knowledge to build things.</p>
          <p>I would say I also have a strong artistic / creative streak with a deep appreciation for efficiency and organization of form, function and design. The aesthetic I strive for is a minimal, simple, elegant and polished form that unfolds complexity and power.  In a word: </p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibui">shibusa (渋さ)</a><br><br>
          <p><i>&quot;A Japanese word which refers to a particular aesthetic of simple, subtle, and unobtrusive beauty. Shibusa objects appear to be simple overall but they include subtle details, such as textures, that balance simplicity with complexity. This balance ensures that one does not tire of a shibusa object but constantly finds new meaning and enriched beauty that cause its aesthetic value to grow over the years...</i></p>
          <p><i>Shibusa walks a fine line between contrasting aesthetic concepts such as elegant and rough or spontaneous and restrained.&quot;</i></p>

            <p><b>3D Studio Max</b> <br>I've worked with a variety of 3d modeling programs since my first foray into Caligari Truspace in 1995. In high school I learned AutoCAD to model a CO2 car that I constructed in Woodshop class. More recently I designed and modeled a <a href="http://coordinatemotionpuzzlebox.blogspot.com/">puzzle box</a> in 3d Studio MAX that I then fabricated at SF Tech Shop. I also used 3DS to model the levels and environments of a 3D game I created called <a href="http://kyuplex.blogspot.com/">kyuplex</a>. I learned MaxScript to convert the levels into a custom XML format that the game rendering engine could read.</p>

            <p><b>Amazon AWS</b> <br>When rebuilding the Go Game website, we initially used Heroku. I elected to migrate to AWS EC2 and managed the instantiation, configuration and deployment of a large website and client intakes forms. I have administered the servers for our website, client payment, and primary game platform. Our website CMS content is stored in a MySQL database on RDS. I have managed our website's static assets on S3 and our gaming platform is tightly integrated with S3 for storing all of our client's media. I've built custom ember components that upload to S3 and micro EC2 HTTP servers that monitor postfix mail server installations. Additionally, my hobby for a period was installing and configuring various Linux distro's on my old Dell Mini netbook. </p>

            <p><b>Twitter Bootstrap</b> <br>I first came across Bootstrap in June 2013 when I was hired at <a href="http://thegogame.com">The Go Game</a>. Our real-world gaming platform uses Bootstrap for all of its applications across several different devices, primarily OSX, iOS and Android. So I have worked extensively with and created several interfaces using the framework. I also used Bootstrap for a custom client game with the <a href="" class="ypo">Young Presidents Organization</a> that was an offline cacheable web app for iPad. (Also my first Ember application) Since then I have used Bootstrap for various projects, and spent a lot of time rummaging around its code and pulling out useful bits and pieces (such as clearfix).</p>

            <p><b>Bullet Physics Library</b> <br> I selected Bullet as the physics library to use for my 3d game project <a href="" class="kyuplex">kyuplex</a>. I successfully integrated the library with the open source 3d rendering engine I was using, <a href="http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net">irrlicht</a>. I worked mostly with dynamic rigid bodies and experimented with several different constraints.</p>

            <p><b>c++</b> <br>My favorite language hands down. All of my favorite software, all of the powerful software, written in c++. And I know exactly why I like it; because it's fast. I remember what a difference it made when I went from a pyGtk UI to a compiled Gtk UI.  Night and day. <br>Python was the first real programming language I learned, followed closely by c and then c++.  As mentioned previously, the bulk of my experience with c++ is from my <a href="" class="kyuplex">kyuplex</a> project. I yearn to come back to it (or another static compiled language) someday.</p>
