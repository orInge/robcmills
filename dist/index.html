          <p>I love programming, conceptual design, languages, and aesthetics. I derive a deep sense of satisfaction from the process of learning, creating, and implementing efficient software solutions, manipulating data to be more palatable, and crafting elegant, extensible, intuitive interfaces.</p>
          <p>Having been a fast-paced FPS PC gamer most of my life, I have a particular passion for optimizing code and low latency. My highly tuned gaming configs made extensive use of key-bindings, which translated nicely to Vim-style modal editing. I use Sublime Text Vintage mode fluently, along with macros and scripts to quickly and productively manipulate code.</p><img id="intp" src="img/intp_logo.png">
          <p>In terms of the <a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org">Myers Briggs personality types</a> I am <b>INTP</b>: <br> <b>I</b>ntroverted i<b>N</b>tuitive <b>T</b>hinking <b>P</b>erceptive</p>
          <p class="quote"><i>"INTP's seek to develop logical explanations for everything that interests them. Theoretical and abstract, interested more in ideas than in social interaction. Quiet, contained, flexible, and adaptable. They have an unusual ability to focus in depth to solve problems in their area of interest. Skeptical, sometimes critical, always analytical."</i></p><img id="way_things_work" src="img/way_things_work.jpg">
          <p>My favorite book as a child was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Things-Work-David-Macaulay/dp/0590429892/ref=pd_sim_b_5">The Way Things Work</a> by David Macaulay, and my favorite toy was my latest Legos set. I think that pretty much sums up my strongest personality trait. I love learning about and understanding the world around me, and then using that knowledge to build things.</p>
          <p>I would say I also have a strong artistic / creative streak with a deep appreciation for efficiency and organization of form, function and design. The aesthetic I strive for is a minimal, simple, elegant and polished form that unfolds complexity and power.  In a word: </p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibui">shibusa (渋さ)</a><br><br>
          <p><i>&quot;A Japanese word which refers to a particular aesthetic of simple, subtle, and unobtrusive beauty. Shibusa objects appear to be simple overall but they include subtle details, such as textures, that balance simplicity with complexity. This balance ensures that one does not tire of a shibusa object but constantly finds new meaning and enriched beauty that cause its aesthetic value to grow over the years...</i></p>
          <p><i>Shibusa walks a fine line between contrasting aesthetic concepts such as elegant and rough or spontaneous and restrained.&quot;</i></p>

            <p><b>3D Studio Max</b> <br>I've worked with a variety of 3d modeling programs since my first foray into Caligari Truspace in 1995. In high school I learned AutoCAD to model a CO2 car that I constructed in Woodshop class. More recently I designed and modeled a <a href="http://coordinatemotionpuzzlebox.blogspot.com/">puzzle box</a> in 3d Studio MAX that I then fabricated at SF Tech Shop. I also used 3DS to model the levels and environments of a 3D game I created called <a href="http://kyuplex.blogspot.com/">kyuplex</a>. I learned MaxScript to convert the levels into a custom XML format that the game rendering engine could read.</p>

            <p><b>Amazon AWS</b> <br>When rebuilding the Go Game website, we initially used Heroku. I elected to migrate to AWS EC2 and managed the instantiation, configuration and deployment of a large website and client intakes forms. I have administered the servers for our website, client payment, and primary game platform. Our website CMS content is stored in a MySQL database on RDS. I have managed our website's static assets on S3 and our gaming platform is tightly integrated with S3 for storing all of our client's media. I've built custom ember components that upload to S3 and micro EC2 HTTP servers that monitor postfix mail server installations. Additionally, my hobby for a period was installing and configuring various Linux distro's on my old Dell Mini netbook. </p>

            <p><b>Twitter Bootstrap</b> <br>I first came across Bootstrap in June 2013 when I was hired at <a href="http://thegogame.com">The Go Game</a>. Our real-world gaming platform uses Bootstrap for all of its applications across several different devices, primarily OSX, iOS and Android. So I have worked extensively with and created several interfaces using the framework. I also used Bootstrap for a custom client game with the <a href="" class="ypo">Young Presidents Organization</a> that was an offline cacheable web app for iPad. (Also my first Ember application) Since then I have used Bootstrap for various projects, and spent a lot of time rummaging around its code and pulling out useful bits and pieces (such as clearfix).</p>

I remember what a difference it made when I went from a pyGtk UI to a compiled Gtk UI.  Night and day. <br>Python was the first real programming language I learned, followed closely by c and then c++.  As mentioned previously, the bulk of my experience with c++ is from my <a href="" class="kyuplex">kyuplex</a> project. I yearn to come back to it (or another static compiled language) someday.</p>

I've also put together a <a href="https://github.com/robcmills/django-base">Django base template</a> that can be used to quickly and easily get a bare bones Django app up and running and deployed to an EC2 instance.

Our real-world gaming platform that we developed at The Go Game uses Ember for all of its client side applications.  I've worked extensively with Ember, building, extending, refactoring, and fixing various components of our multi-application suite.

But it took a long time and a lot of hard work to go from Python to c to c++ to irrlicht. An open-source 3d rendering engine that I used for <a href="" class="kyuplex">kyuplex</a>.

        </div>
        <div class="content-section">
          <h4>The Problem:</h4>
          <p>Videos would periodically stop loading, and show only a black screen in our judging presentation app. This app is used in front of large audiences at the end of nearly every game we run, and so this particular bug was classified CODE RED and I set about finding a fix ASAP. </p>
          <h4>The Solution:</h4>
          <p>Finding <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=234779">this Chromium issue</a> is what helped me finally figure this out;</p>
          <p>When the browser requests video or audio content, it includes the <code>Range</code> and <code>Connection:keep-alive</code> headers in order to download only a small portion of the content quickly, in anticipation that the user may decide not to play the media content before leaving the page. This keeps the connection open until the video is actually played:</p>
          <p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4131746/8681880/ebadd6ec-2a1e-11e5-9261-96a28b4f8fab.png" style="max-width:100%;"></p>
          <p>This causes a problem in the localjudging app because when ember routes to a new video, we simply replace the <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> url and rerender:</p>
          <pre> <code class="javascript">Preso.MediaItemShowView = Ember.View.extend(
...
contentDidChange: function() {
  if(this.state === 'inDOM') { this.rerender(); }
}.observes('controller.content')
</code></pre>
          <p>This leaves the pending <code>206 Partial Content</code> requests open, and Chrome allows only 6 open connections per domain. Thus, once that maximum is reached, further requests are not allowed and stall, causing the black screen of death.</p>
          <p>The solution, according to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML5_audio_and_video">Mozilla Development Network&#39;s HTML5 Audio and Video Guide</a> is to stop the download of the media immediately and close the request by setting the media element's <code>src</code> attribute to an empty string:</p>
          <pre><code class="javascript">contentDidChange: function() {
if(this.state === 'inDOM') { 
  if(this.get('controller.isVideo')) {
    var video = this.$('video').get(0);
    video.src = '';
  }
  this.rerender(); 
}

          <p>We are expanding our business into Europe and would like to utilize Mezzanine's <em>multi-tenancy</em> feature to implement multiple sites within one Django installation. The European site would share most of our content, however we want to isolate their content so they can safely edit it without affecting the US site. Thus I needed to do a complicated data migration of the majority of the site tree. Given Mezzanine's complex Page model and the high degree of relational fields present in our models, this turned into a fairly complex task. The results of my efforts follow.
